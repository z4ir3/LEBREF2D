# LEBREF2D 1.0

## A MATLAB 2D mesh refinement package

LEBREF2D is a MATLAB package for the mesh refinement 2D domains based on an efficient usage of MATLAB built-in functions and vectorization. Local adaptive mesh refinement is based on the longest edge bisection (LEB) algorithm. 
 
**Tested with MATLAB 8.4.0.150421 (R2014b)**

Run the adaptive demo *lebdemo.m* for a demonstration and check the short documentation *doc.pdf* for information.
